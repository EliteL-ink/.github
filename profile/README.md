## EliteLink (엘리트링크) - Social Discovery App

Welcome to EliteLink, a cutting-edge social discovery app that connects socially validated individuals for meaningful relationships. Our mission is to provide a safe and efficient platform for verified men and women to meet and form genuine connections. With advanced technology and user-centric design, EliteLink offers a superior social discovery experience.

Key Features
Verified Profiles: Men can join by undergoing verification of income, education, occupation, social status, and assets. Women can join by undergoing a beauty evaluation, and they also have the option to complete the same verification process as men.

LinkEye AI Matchmaking: Our state-of-the-art LinkEye AI feature uses natural language processing to recommend the most compatible matches based on users' preferences. Say what you're looking for in a partner, and LinkEye will find the best matches within your desired age range.

Enhanced Security: We prioritize user safety and privacy. Profile photos and text content undergo automatic screening using computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Only approved content is visible to other users.

In-App Credits: EliteLink utilizes an in-app credit system for various interactions. Users can use credits to express interest, send and accept likes, and exchange contact information. In-app credits can be purchased through secure in-app payments.
